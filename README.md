## 🧭 About Me

I am a **freelance graphic artist and illustrator** from Hungary, with almost two decades of experience in both traditional and digital art.  
My work bridges **visual storytelling, mysticism, and modern interface design**.  
In recent years, I’ve begun integrating **blockchain, NFT, and Web3 concepts** into interactive design and user experience projects.

My style combines **classical fantasy illustration** with **modern, clean, and intuitive layouts** inspired by alchemy, consciousness science, and nature’s geometry.

# 🌌 Aurora.Quest – UI/UX Design Project (under developement)
## 🧭 Overview
**Aurora.Quest** is an interactive learning portal concept that merges storytelling, visual art, and user-centered design.  
It follows *Aurora and her Magicfox* through a journey of knowledge and discovery, where each section represents an element of consciousness and growth.

This project represents my transition into **UI/UX design**, where I experiment with layout, navigation, and emotional design.  
While I’m still **new to Figma**, I use **Photoshop, Wix**, and **basic HTML/CSS** to prototype ideas and bring visual storytelling into interface form.

## 🧩 Highlights
- Conceptual wireframes and layout flow
- Scroll-based transitions with layered background art
- Educational & gamified UI concept
- Character-driven storytelling through design

 🪶 Vision
To create **immersive, meaningful digital experiences** that inspire curiosity and connection.
